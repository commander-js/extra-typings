## Issues

New issues are welcome, whether questions or suggestions or reporting bugs.
You are also welcome to contribute by adding helpful comments on an existing issue.

We love reproducible code examples in questions and answers.

If you get a satisfactory reply to a question then please close your issue, but it is ok to leave an issue open for more replies or interest. Inactive issues may get closed after one month if they have an answer,
or after six months otherwise.

## Pull Requests

Please submit pull requests against the develop branch.

Follow the existing code style. Check the tests succeed.

- `npm run test`

Don't update the CHANGELOG or package version number. That gets done by maintainers when preparing the release.
